  - VR Casted Light / Light Physics - casting
  - How we (individually) address the idea of optics? Physical optics, screen optics, and projection optics.
  - Projection is bounced light / Screen is direct light / Classic TRON / VR spaces built out of light.
  - Light Scanning, Light bounding, capturing Light Rays
  - Real and Virtual Light
