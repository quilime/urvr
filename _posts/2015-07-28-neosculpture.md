## NEO-SCULPTURE | 3D PRINTING / RAPID PROTOTYPING / VR / SITE-SPECIFIC

## NAAG (VER.2012 SITE-SPECIFIC  / VER.2015 SITE-SPECIFIC)

- For website: Create GIFs to supplement video?
- “NAAG produces a sensation through movement”
- “naag comes purely from mining the medium -- the medium of the physical sculpture and the digital surface is experiential.”

## NAAG (from Gabe’s notes)

NAAG started as a skype conversation between Gabriel Dunne and Vishal K Dar, which resulted in the two of them working in Dar's house and studio on the outskirts of Delhi, in Gurgaon on a self-funded residency. NAAG was conceptualized and executed during a 2 month period, and debuted during the India Art Fair 2012.

Dunne had been working with geometry generated from processes, and keenly interested in islamic-inspired non periodic tiling patterns, and ultimately was experimenting with generative patterns using GLSL shaders. Graphics were created using trigonometric functions resulting in sinusoidal interference patterns and  quasicrystal formation. The algorithmic loops written in GLSL are a euclidian representation of the the engineering process used by the original builders of sacred temples and architectures found in the middle east and asia; a digital version of the manual procedural process in their design. The human and the digital are using identical methodologies, with contrasting implementations.

A computer language like GLSL uses iterative looping structures that colorize each pixel of a digital display. A human uses a series of construction rules with a compass and straightedge. Both are using a rules-based code to arrive in the visual presentation.

The connection with the physical came during experimenting with skinning sculptural shapes with digital projections in the studio. The texture appeared like lace over a body or organic muscle. Some more experimentation resulted in stretching out the edge of the texture. By importing digital representations of the objects, the texture mapping was manipulated to allow the geometries to flow in organic and muscular ways. The edge of the texture was stretched, rather than repeated, resulting in binary stripes resembling barcodes, emphasis its digital nature.

A series of works that are based on principles through which we developed and produced NAAG.
note: I was listening to Strauss and he comes across as a sculptor. One should try and understand the dialog between sound and sculpture.

A CNC process that uses optical sensors to analyse an object and decide what it's sculpting as it makes it -- Connects to the NEO Sculpture. Ref: Deep Dream but for sculpture.

  - Machine Vision / Learning.
  - How to expand our imaginations collectively.
  - Optical CNC process

This series of works will be produced with the following themes + technologies:

  - themes prevalent in classical sculpture (western + eastern) / body politics
  - sculpting (with some reference to architecture) in the digital times
  - materiality + fabrication
  - projection mapping
  - form produced with sound
