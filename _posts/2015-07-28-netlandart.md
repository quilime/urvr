## NET-LAND ART | TEXT / NET / AR / VR

This could possibly be a great area of research and paper writing for us. It might lead us to a certain space of archeology since both land art and net art are going to be the most relevant topics for future discourse on how contemporary art practices shaped up.  This could also have a connect to the idea of 'floating worlds' (hinting at shared VR spaces such as a mobile phone) and further define the scale (aspiration) and meaning within the digital. It also could take into consideration what happens to data as we age.

We will have to build a discourse where we connect films such as 'close encounters of the 3rd kind / tron' to 'robet smithson / james turrell'. Also this would be the section where we can include NASA.

I am not yet sure how this will fit in but I have a feeling it'll somehow become the spine project of this section.

> "Sea travelers from medieval times wrote accounts of the magical creatures that they saw at sea and on distant lands. These descriptions of fantastical creatures of the sea. God like monsters the inhabitants that were either woken up from their sleep or seen frolicking around or they were fought against. These images filled with wonder became the madman's dream."
