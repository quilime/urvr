Founding members lay out the strategies from the opposite sides of Earth, Dunne being in the USA and Dar in INDIA, to develop remote working model for

- Partnerships, Co-Labs and Curated Collectives for Art Production
- Representation
- A practice of possibilities through conversations and engagements with like-minded artists, film-makers, theorist, gamers, etc.
- Founding members as Editors or Associates

## Audience

The collectives works exist in the physical and the digital. The digital representation of the works are a fragment or a non-tangible glimpse of the larger work. On the web our audience are art and culture groups, people interested and searching for new technology, people interested in art and visual statements. Social platforms: Instagram/Twitter. Experimental social platforms: Deep Web encrypted portals, requiring authenticated encrypted key. Target and calculated social media bursts.

## Questions to be discussed

  - What URVR would mean as a studio space?
  - What is a partnership, and what is it going to be?
  - Out time and investments
  - Do we want commerce?
  - Do we want to invest in grants?
  - Are we an arts studio or an arts org?
  - Will the new form automatically emerge from the internet, or will it be something inserted/injected into the internet?
  - How do we bring in the idea of SCALE with digital? The digital doesn't allow for an idea of scale conveniently. What does SCALE mean when we look at the digital.
  - URVR will put out open call to up and coming artists and will curate a show (maybe online).
